                <br>
                <br>
                I normally use my phone camera to capture moments and save them to my camera roll, or to show them to people later on. For this I used my camera to take picture of boba that we were selling and advertising it to friends

                <br>
                I use facetime a lot to call people because I'm not much of a big texter. I respond more to facetimes then I do text messages, and because people know I don't reply quickly on text they normally facetime, which is why I'm actively on the app.

                I usually use fuji film cameras to take nicer pictures of the events that I go to. The picture being shown is my family in my fraternity, and it was the day I got my first littles.

                <br>
                    I normally use my phone camera to capture moments and save them to my camera roll, or to show them to people later on. For this I used my camera to take a picture of us wine tasting during my friend's birthday in a winery.
